# Multi-Class Classification with EfficientNet B0

This repository contains a baseline implementation for multi-class image classification using EfficientNet B0, focused on the [DH Data Rev dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/being0606/dhdata-rev) from Kaggle.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle:
- [DH Data Rev Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/being0606/dhdata-rev)

## Example Code

You can find the example code for training and evaluating the model with this dataset on Kaggle:
- [Baseline Code for DH Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/code/being0606/dh-compettition1-teamgrinder)

## Quick Start

To get started, download the dataset from the link above and follow the steps in the Kaggle notebook for setting up your environment and running the code.
